We are a small community group and keeping this website updated with stories is a challenge! No experience of content writing is required, you just a passion for the park and attending Friends of Highfield Country Park meetings. Some ideas for new content could be writing about nature on the park, covering events that have happened, looking into the history of the park, or interviewing Friends group volunteers, some of whom have some great stories. If you think you can help, please fill in the form on our <a href="volunteer.html">Volunteering page</a> and let us know and we can have a chat.</p>

                        <p class="col-xs-12 body-content">The new development on Cringle Road, for 57 houses, was rejected last year. Earlier in 2018 it was rejected on appeal by the planning inspectorate. However, it appears that the only outstanding objection is for the developers to contribute to the improvement of the park. The developers have notified the Friends group that they are preparing to submit another application. If you want to be notified when this application is actually submitted, so you can register your opinion on this development, you can fill out the form below.</p>

                        <header><h3>Wild Awake Mindfulness Experience - Blog Post</h3></header>

                        <p class="body-content">On Monday 4th September 2018, a small group of us met at Bowler St entrance to the park do an hour of mindfulness with Claire from Wild Awake Mindfulness, and I was attending my first session of outdoor mindfulness in the park. We walked down the little path into the woods. After introducing ourselves, Claire did a couple of short sitting meditations. I noticed that meditating on breath was much easier than indoors alone, and more relaxing than group sessions indoors. The sounds from the park such as birdsong and wind in the trees, the feel of the wind on skin, and simply being in the open air made it much easier to focus on the moment. Even when there were distractions, such as laughter from the picnic areas and noisy crows crying harshly above, it didn't distract us. We also did some lying meditation, and saw a different side to the woods, watching squirrels and birds hopping about in the trees before closing our eyes. By the time we had finished, it was getting dark, and I felt good to have really felt the passage from day to night. There are some more sessions happening over the next few weeks, see the event below for details!</p>

                        <p class="body-content">At some point between Thursday 7th and Saturday the 9th June, vandals damaged the forest school area, where there is a clearing and log seats. The log seats were set fire to, and a number of trees were cut down, apparently for no reason, two oak trees and one birch was cut and the marks appear to be from hand saws, which would have been a lot of work! We were worried that this would affect the forest school activities that are run with children from St Marys. But the school children visited the site and still enjoyed themselves, so we are likely to leave it as is now, and the 5 x 2 hour sessions will be run as planned. The cut trees provide new things to climb on for the children, which offsets the loss of seats! Please note, it is dangerous to cut trees like this especially if you do not have a licence.</p>

                        <p class="body-content">Recently we have had a series of awful cold snaps, bringing snow and ice. However, this has not affecting the bird and pond life. Sightings over the last few months have included nightingales - although some people have challenged this claim, suggesting it could have been a black cap. There is now a heron that can be sometimes seen on the park. Bullfinches and goldfinches can be seen too. The success of the birds may be in part due to the diverse trees. Some trees such as the cypress due to the way they trap air, can be 6c-9c warmer than the air temperature. We have also seen freshwater shrimp in the ponds - a sign of healthy clean water.</p>
                        <p class="body-content">Many thanks too for all who put out nuts and seeds on the park for the birds to keep them fed over the cold period. This made a massive difference!</p>

The bats in the park are at risk and we are doing what we can to support them. See below for photos. </p>

                        <p class="body-content">The Friends of Highfield Country Park are bidding for funds to create a bee sanctuary in the park. Our idea is to create a Bee sanctuary garden in Highfield, one that all can enjoy and use as a walk through, and a place to sit and soak up the sun in the beautiful garden. A place where people can be educated and become closer to nature, but most of all for the bees of Manchester! As we all know, our bees need help, and it is vital that we help protect them. The aim is to have as many fruit trees, flowers, plants herbs and grasses that bees can flourish in, whilst creating an elegant space for families and other wildlife to enjoy. There would be a trail, which includes facts about bees, their different species, how they protect us and how we can help protect them. <a href="https://www.avivacommunityfund.co.uk/voting/project/view/17-3871">Read more and vote for us on the Aviva website!</a></p>

                        <header><h3>Plans to Develop on Highfield Country Park Rejected</h3></header>


                        <p class="body-content">Plans were submitted by Towerhouse Systems to propose developing 57 houses on Cringle Road by Highfield Country Park. This would have covered the land where the Shores Fold Community Farm currently stands. </p>

                        <p>Reasons given for the council rejecting this development included:
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lack of access </strong> :- since it is assumed that each household may have two cars each, 114 cars may have to use Cringle Road for access. The roads were not considered big enough to cope with this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shores Fold Community Farm </strong> :- the farm is unique to this area, allowing families to visit and get tours of the animals. The loss of this farm would mean children would not get a chance to learn about animals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bat population </strong>:- bats have been confirmed to be living in Highfield Country Park and are a protected species. The loss of farmland would have an detrimental impact on their numbers. Now that this has been confirmed, we hope to do more work to support the bats.</li>
                          </ul>

                          For more information on this planning application see the documents at <a href="http://pa.manchester.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=OQK6U8BCLRJ00">the Manchester Council website</a>.

                        <p class="body-content">Volunteers Peter and Steve put in a new bench by the pond just by Nelstrop Road. This Tolkien-esque pond looks wild enough to make you think you may find crocodiles inside! And now there is a place for you to relax here, with a new bench that is in place. The new bins have been put in by the picnic area by Bowler St, by St Andrews, and on the path along by Cringle Road.</p>
